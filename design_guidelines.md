# Design Guidelines for "Along The Nile" Luxury Tourism Website

## Design Approach: Reference-Based (Luxury Travel)

**Primary References:** Airbnb Luxe, Four Seasons, Belmond, high-end travel platforms
**Rationale:** Luxury tourism is experience-focused where visual appeal, emotional resonance, and perceived exclusivity drive conversions. The design must convey premium quality and Egyptian sophistication to attract high-end international travelers.

## Core Design Principles
- **Opulent Simplicity:** Luxurious without clutter, generous whitespace with premium accents
- **Cultural Authenticity:** Egyptian heritage woven subtly through patterns, colors, and motifs
- **Aspirational Imagery:** Every visual should evoke desire and exclusivity
- **Effortless Elegance:** Navigation and booking flow should feel seamless and refined
